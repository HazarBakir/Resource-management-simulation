# Resource Management Simulation Project

This project is a resource management simulation game where users control forklift and human objects to collect and manage resources.

## Core Features

### Forklift Management

- When left-clicked on forklift objects, a green icon will appear on the selected forklifts.
- After selecting a forklift, right-clicking will make the forklift move along the specified route. If the destination is a resource, it will automatically start collecting the resource.
- After collecting resources, the forklift will transport them to the truck, and the process will automatically repeat.

### Human Management

- When left-clicked on human objects, a green icon will appear on the selected humans.
- After selecting humans, right-clicking will make them move along the specified route. If the destination is a resource, they will increase the resource replenishment speed.

### Resource Management

- After collecting resources, the resources will be reset, and the resource replenishment process will begin.
- As humans increase the resource replenishment speed, the time required for resource replenishment will decrease.

### (Left-Click) for Object Details

- Upon left-clicking any object, details about the selected object will be displayed in the top-left corner.
- Users can utilize this information to enhance their in-game strategies and optimize their management.
